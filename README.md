## 💡 What is Quadratic Funding?

Quadratic funding is a democratic funding mechanism where the total match for a project is based not just on how much is contributed, but **how many people contribute**. The idea is that broad support is more valuable than big donations from a few people.

**Formula:**
Matching = (sum of sqrt(contributions))²
